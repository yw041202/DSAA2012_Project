1. Run data_preprocessing file to gain the preprocessed data in pkl form (remember checking the loaded data file name in main.py).
2. Use "python main.py" to run the proposed model.
3. For the baselines ("B_Longformer.py" and "B_XGBoost.py"), please run corresponding files using similar command in 2 but change the file name.

It is essential to check installing all the needed library or model, and check the cache path before running any code.
